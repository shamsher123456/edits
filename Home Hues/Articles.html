            <h2>Shades Of Grey</h2>
      <p> In recent years, grays have transitioned from being a bold choice to a commonplace option for home decor, according to Xaykao. "We selected Metropolitan AF-690, a classic silvery gray, as our 2019 Color of the Year to reflect this trend</p>
            
            <p>No longer merely subdued neutrals, grays have overtaken whites as the go-to choice. "They signify a fresh start, and their subtle undertones add a touch of sophistication," Xaykao observes, emphasizing why grays have become the darling of home staging.</p>
          <p>One of the key perks of embracing grays is their ability to set the stage—especially in communal areas. "Sitting perfectly at the center of the color wheel, grays act as a versatile canvas for a myriad of hues and design aesthetics," Xaykao asserts, underscoring their unparalleled adaptability.</p></div>

            <h2>Pale Palettes</h2>
        <p>Pale colors convey freshness. “Like grays, they provide an alternative or supplement to your staple whites,” Xaykao says. “They create subtle dimension in a space and play off the light in intriguing ways like a modern, sophisticated rainbow.
            </p>
            <p>They also evoke a sense of calm, says Charleston-based interior designer Elizabeth Stuart, principal of Elizabeth Stuart Design. “Our lives are busier than ever, and pastels bring peace to a design,” Stuart mentions.</p>
            <p>Because they’re soothing shades, pastels naturally befit certain rooms, such as nurseries or dressing rooms, Stuart adds. She also likes to use them with a high-lacquer finish in living rooms or as a backdrop for a stronger accent wall. In addition, Xaykao recommends combining colors rather than featuring any one pastel shade—for a hallway or in an open-plan area to lightly delineate rooms.</p>

     <div class="Greens"></div>
        <div class="headings2">
            <h2>Greens We Envy</h2>
        <p>Thanks to a general move toward green living, green hues have a new cool factor. “We’ve had a ‘hot’ green these past few years; last year, it was weightless glass greens and acidic shades; lately, it’s been more muted sage, moss, and olive,” Xaykao notes.
            </p>
            <p>When I design with green, generally, I am paying attention to something that I’m drawing into the room from outside,” Stuart says. “Many times, it forms a connection between the interior and the exterior, and is a way to bring the garden and nature inside.</p>
            <p>It’s a great color for layering multiple shades—the base room color, then the sofa and pillows, for example,” Stuart remarks. In fact, greens can almost function as a neutral. “They aren’t as divisive as other color families, so they have wide appeal and immediately set a welcoming tone in the home,” Xaykao says. And since they cover such a wide spectrum, from yellow to blue, pale to dark, greige to jewel tone, there’s a lot of room to play within the color family. While they work with any décor style, if you want to keep the vibe from being too nature-focused, bring in sleeker finishes and keep the styling on the minimal side.</p>

            <h2>Bewitching Browns</h2>
        <p>Color trends have been moving in a warmer direction, which points to a desire to connect to something more natural and organic. “Woodsy and leathery browns are timeless, and we’ve featured some beautiful brownish-blacks and nutty browns in our Color Trends the past few years,” Xaykao adds.

            <p>Color trends have been moving in a warmer direction, which points to a desire to connect to something more natural and organic. “Woodsy and leathery browns are timeless, and we’ve featured some beautiful brownish-blacks and nutty browns in our Color Trends the past few years,” Xaykao adds.</p>
            <p>A little brown goes a long way. Xaykao proposes experimenting with the color on a trim or accent wall. “You’ll be surprised by how well brown works with a wide range of colors,” she says. Juxtaposition and balance are key to freshening up brown. “The rich color can get heavy, so it helps to keep ornamentation in the room to a minimum, and to use white and light neutrals strategically,” Xaykao recommends.</p>

        <div class="headings4">
            <h2>Warm Neutrals</h2>
        <p>Along with browns, there’s a move toward warm neutrals: “Not the creamy beiges of yesteryear but something ‘drier’ along the lines of putty, mushroom, and taupe,” Xaykao says.
            </p>
            <p>Warm neutrals can infuse an organic, unprocessed quality akin to materials like adobe and linen to the home,” Xaykao notes. “At the same time, the raw, elemental quality of this palette can bring an artful, sculptural quality to walls.</p>
            <p>Consider a warm neutral as an alternative to gray or, better yet, use it along with gray. “Layering neutrals and ramping up textures is a great way to show off your personality and bring dimension to a space in an understated way,” Xaykao says.</p>
