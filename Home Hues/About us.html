            <h1>Home Color Expert: How It Began</h1>
            </div>
        <div class="abouttext2">
            Inspired by the timeless elegance of Martha Stewart Living Magazines, my passion for color, interior design, cooking, gardening, and creating beauty blossomed in my early 20s. Despite a fulfilling career in the medical field spanning nearly three decades, I longed for a chance to unleash my creative spirit.

As my husband and I embarked on the journey of selling and buying our dream home, I found myself immersed in online real estate listings, often dismayed by poorly chosen renovation finishes and dated color schemes. It struck me that there had to be a better approach to home design, one that eschewed the wasteful cycle of tearing out trendy choices, filling landfills in the process.

Determined to cultivate a home that reflected our lifestyle and aesthetic, I embarked on a journey of education under the tutelage of Maria Killam, a renowned international color expert. Through her guidance, I honed the ability to discern undertones in neutrals and colors, understanding the intricate nuances that make or break a space's harmony.

Armed with this newfound expertise, I founded Home Hues, a color consulting business aimed at empowering homeowners to curate timeless, harmonious spaces without the need for a full-fledged interior designer. By identifying and rectifying undertone conflicts, I help clients achieve transformative results, where surfaces, furnishings, and wall colors seamlessly coalesce to elevate their living environments.

At Home Hues, we believe that every home has a story to tell, and we're here to ensure that story is told in hues that stand the test of time."
